            <h2>What is this Website for?</h2>
            <p>This website was created for the purpose of putting aspiring game developers projects onto the internet.<br>
            I personaly (mr Bones) think that the best way to learn game dev is to get people to play what you make as soon as possible.<br>
            For this purpose please enjoy the games knowing that they may not be of the best quality.</p>
